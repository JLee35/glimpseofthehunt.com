        Preserving a dream starts the second the heart stops. Your trophy needs
        to be brought to the shop or frozen immediately. Remember to keep skin
        to skin, hair to hair, if frozen, try to hide the lips, eyes, and ears
        inside the cape to protect these sensitive areas. My goal is to have
        your trophy back in nine months so you can display your dream! Thanks
        for your business and good luck hunting!
